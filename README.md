# C-Sharp-Golfer-Simulation
This project simulates matchups between golfers, be they modern, historical, or fictional. This is an extension of my other repository, golfsimcode, which was a console-only application. This project is meant to provide a visual interface for that repository, by building what I previously made frome the ground up as I learn C#, WPF, and XAML. Right now the repository is in a very basic state, features will be added frequently to make the application more robust.
